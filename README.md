# Email Attachments

## Intro

Inspired by
[hey.com/features/all-files](https://www.hey.com/features/all-files/),
"attachments" reads emails from your local [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org)
database, adding a query to only display emails with attachments, providing
quick access to the files, with only a small amount of filters e.g. "Date",
"Contact".

## Status

## Requirements
