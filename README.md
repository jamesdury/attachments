# Email Attachments

## Intro

Inspired by
[hey.com/features/all-files](https://www.hey.com/features/all-files/), "attachments" reads emails from your local [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org) database, adding a query for to only display emails with attachments.

The goal of this project is to provide quick access to attachments, with a small amount of filters e.g. "By Date", "By Contact".
